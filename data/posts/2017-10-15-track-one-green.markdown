Having a successful product or business, is much more than just using the latest tools or technologies. Having a good team of programmers is not enough. So this year, we decided to do things a little bit different. 

We thought it would be important to tackle all the different topics that complement technology and that are crucial for successful products. Therefore, this year we decided to split the talks into two different and in parallel tracks, one about tools and development and another to all its related areas.

**Ana Ribeiro**, Head of Operations & PMO at DSSC, will start with the unfair role of Project Managers among an organization and why they are so important. Later on, **Cláudia Morgado** (COO at RedLight), will also add her take on why Google thinks how the team members interact, structure their work, and view their contributions is more important than the members themselves.

We couldn’t talk about software without mentioning design and its importance on the products. For that, we will have two different talks, one from **Guilherme Corte-Real** (UX at Zomato) and **Hugo Froes** from Hi Interactive which will talk about on how we can, and should, design for the user. As a result, we will explore some simple ways of making the user an integral part of your process.

Up next, we will have **Sandro Batista** from FocusBc which will talk about the important of location on any project and how can we leverage businesses with that kind of knowledge. On a different take, location is an important subject not only for the products but also for all the team members. And even though it is common to have a fixed place for the team, **Sam Carecho** will share with us how we no longer need to be confined to a city or space, to be able to development success products. 

So don’t forget to join us on 11th November by getting your ticket here ([https://2event.com/en/events/1010022](https://2event.com/en/events/1010022) )

We hope to see you soon!
