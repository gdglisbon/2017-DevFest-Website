Technology is moving and spreading at a faster pace than ever before and we want to make sure you won’t be left behind. From our living room, to our Kitchen or even our streets, the internet of things is shaping the world as we know today. 

And when we add Artificial Intelligence to the mix, the possibilities are limitless. 

We will start off the day with **Martin Split** (GDE) in which we will do a deep dive into WebVR using Mozilla's A-Frame library.
Next up, **Amahdy Abdelaziz** will explore how can we boost the usability of web and mobile-web apps by implementing offline-first functionalities in order to guarantee 100% always on user experience.

Machine-learning and deep neural networks are a great topic nowadays and no one better to talk about it than **Mario Cordeiro** from Critical Software. He will deep dive into TensorFlow, a library originally developed at Google, and how we can make our applications smarter with it.

Straight from the Netherlands, **Bob Van Luijt** (GDE) will tell us how can the Internet of Things help us create a knowledge repository to understand the world and how can we use tools like the cloud to achieve that purpose. And about Cloud, we will have **David Cifuentes** (GDE) from Zalando, that will tell us how having a good combination of methodology with a robust infrastructure can really make the difference. He will show us how we can deploy a Python microservice on the Google Cloud using Connexion, App Engine Flexible and Cloud Endpoints following API first principles.

Finally, **Bea Hernandez** (Data Scientist at DatMean) will explain us how we can do statistics and analytics with the R language and tidyverse, a fast, friendly, and high level set of packages designed for data science.

But we couldn’t have a **DevFest** without a talk about Android and for such, we will have **Sergio Santos** from Bloco.io joining us.

All these sessions will be on Track 2, so make sure you get a ticket here ( [https://2event.com/en/events/1010022](https://2event.com/en/events/1010022) )

We hope to see you soon!
