As an independent and voluntary community, we know how hard and time consuming it can be
to organize events for communities all around the world. As a result, we decided to offer
free tickets to all community organizers that are interested in joining us for our Devfest.
Just send us an email ( lisbongdg@gmail.com ) and any reference to prove it and we will provide you a free ticket with no strings attached!

Thank you for your commitment and willingness to create a better and more helpful world.
